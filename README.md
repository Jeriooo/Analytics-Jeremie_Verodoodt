Welcome!

Every byte of data has a stroy to tell and the primary purpose of this avenue is to share my journey through the wolrd of analytics and provide an overview of some of my work within it. My personal competencies can be broken down into the relms of finance/business , data engineering and mathematics/statistical analysis.

This page is broken down into 4 secions, namely:
 - [Data ingestion and file management](#Data-ingestion-and-file-management) 
 - [Data cleaning and normalising](#Data-cleaning-and-normalising)
 - [Business operational analysis](#Business-operational-analysis)

Technologies utilised include **Python, Power Query, SQL and Excel**. It is worth noting that I am currently developing system based solutions for the purpose of Data Engineering that include  Linux and Docker, Airflow / Kafka , Elastic Search / Apache Spark/ Databricks / dbt , Amazon Redshift / Mongo DB/  Big Query / Snowflake etc)
