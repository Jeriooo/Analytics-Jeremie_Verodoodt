Welcome!

Every byte of data has a stroy to tell and the primary purpose of this resource is to share some insights into my journey and work within the world of analytics. In terms of competencies, my knowledge/experience can be broken down into primarily 3 difference categories: Business & Finance, Date Engineering & BI and Mathematics / Statistical Analysis. I am passionate about the advent of big data and how it has impacted the way organisations make decisions.

You will find that this page consists of illustrations (code etc within individual repos) of projects that I have conducted throughout the FULL LIFECYCLE of the development of a data product, namely; 

 - [Data ingestion and file management](#Data-ingestion-and-file-management) 
 - [Data cleaning and normalising](#Data-cleaning-and-normalising)
 - [Business operational analysis](#Business-operational-analysis)
 - [Visualisations](#Visualisations)

It is worth noting that the technologies utilised typically include an advanced level of python and SQL (including db administration) , other "application level" software (NoSQL stores such as Cassandra, processing engines/frameworks such as Spark and data consumption tools such as Power BI and Tableau) AND implementations (including Docker and cloud services such as Azure, AWS and GCP).
