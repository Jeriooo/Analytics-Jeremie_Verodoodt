Welcome!

The primary purpose of this avenue is to provide an quick overview of my **_Data-Specific_/Busines Intelligence** skillset through illustrations of work that I have conducted in the past. 

This page is broken down into 4 secions, namely:
 - [Data ingestion and file management](#Data-ingestion-and-file-management) 
 - [Data cleaning and normalising](#Data-cleaning-and-normalising)
 - [Business operational analysis](#Business-operational-analysis)
 - [Visualisations](#Visualisations)

Technologies utilised include **Python, Power Query, SQL and Excel**. It is worth noting that I am currently developing system based solutions for the purpose of Data Engineering that include  Linux and Docker, Airflow / Kafka , Elastic Search / Apache Spark/ Databricks / dbt , Amazon Redshift / Mongo DB/  Big Query / Snowflake etc)
