Hi there, welcome to my page! 

The primary purpose of this avenue is to provide an overview of my **_Data-Specific_/Busines Intelligence** skillset along with various visualiations of work that I have conducted in the past. It is worth noting that my experience extends to the wider Computer Science field and other other domains such as Finance/Business and Mathematics. 

-> Currenlty undergoing more big data - specific tool projects (ie Linux, Airflow, Apache Spark, Amazon Redshift, Big Query, Snowflake etc)
