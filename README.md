Hi there, welcome to my page! 

The primary purpose of this avenue is to provide an overview of my **_Data-Specific_/Busines Intelligence** skillset along with various visualiations of work that I have conducted in the past. It is worth noting that my experience extends to the wider Computer Science field and other other domains such as Finance/Business and Mathematics. 

~*Full-spectrum Data Engineering project illustrations coming soon*

1 -> Data Supply / Engineering {Undergoing further study}

    INGESTION: 
    > Connection to API's and other internal systems via Python (Spyder and Jupyter)
    > Direct-database extraction utilising SQL (Microsoft Azure SQL database)
    
    BUFFER/ORCHESTRACTION:
    > Platform-dependent tools aside, airflow is the route of choice
    > Batch scripting for minor projects
    > Currently developing projects utilising Kafa
   
    PROCESSING:
    > Stand procedure of implementing Spark for big data processing
    > Docker as a platform development / software packaging tool
    
    STORAGE: 
    > Relational database: Postgres
    > Warehousing: Amazon Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery 
    > Data lakes: Amazon S3, MongoDD (No SQL), Elastic search 
    
2 -> Data consumption: {Business Intelligence/Data Analytics}:

    > General purpose analytics: Power Query, Power Pivot, Advanced Excel.
    > Dashboarding: Advanced Power BI (including bookmarks, dynamic titles, mobile reporting etc)
    > Machine learning / Business analytics: Advanced Excel (scenario analysis etc) and Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Pytorch etc)
